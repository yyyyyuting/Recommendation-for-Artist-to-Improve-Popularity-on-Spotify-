# Recommendation-for-Artist-to-Improve-Popularity-on-Spotify-
## The problem that motivates the analysis you will conduct
Sometimes Spotify users want to search for artists similar to whom the user is currently listening to. We know that Spotify has a recommendation function based on music genres. Therefore, we are wondering if music artists can be segmented into liked groups based on their music forms and style. Once artists are classified, Spotify will be able to pull artist names from the same cluster which the currently listened artist is in. By adding the feature of recommending similar artists, Spotifyâ€™s usability will improve as well.
